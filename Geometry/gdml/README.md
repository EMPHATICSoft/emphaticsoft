Need to install GDMLUtil.pm in perl path (/etc/perl)

Run by
./phase2/make_gdml.sh

Phase-1
- T0 implemented
- Target implemented
- Magnet implemented (material only, EM field not by gdml)
- SSD implemented (rough position only, precise position in calibration module)
- RPC implemented (material needs more work)
- LG implemented (LG material and optical property needs more work)
